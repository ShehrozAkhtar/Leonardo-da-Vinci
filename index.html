    <p style="color: cornsilk; border:2px solid Powderblue;">Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was an Italian polymath whose diverse talents spanned painting, science, engineering, anatomy, and more. Known primarily for iconic paintings like the *Mona Lisa* and *The Last Supper*, his art demonstrates his deep understanding of anatomy, light, and perspective. Leonardo was also an inventor and a scientist, filling his notebooks with sketches and studies of flying machines, anatomical drawings, and scientific observations that were far ahead of his time. His insatiable curiosity and visionary ideas have cemented his place as one of history's greatest minds, embodying the spirit of the Renaissance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Click For More Details</a><br></p>
